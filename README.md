# DynamicTableView

This project is an example of loading dynamic data in table from URL with core data caching. First data is loaded from table view then after that background refresh happens where UI and CoreData gets updated.

Pull to refresh implemented for table view.
Alert views added for showing error messages or passing information to the user.

Programmatically added UI components (No stroyBoard used)

#PODS
SwiftKeychainWrapper to store UserInfo to KeyChain like emailID.
Alamofire pod used for calling service for data asynchrnously.
SDWebImage pod used for caching and image downloading and rendering.
NVActivityIndicatorView ADDED TO SHOW ACTIVITY INDICATOR.

Followed MVP design pattern to develop the app.

Constraints are set programmatically.

UnitTest class added for HomeViewPesenter Class.

Proper commenting is done whereever required.

Couldn't give more time because of busy schedule.

Cheerios!!
